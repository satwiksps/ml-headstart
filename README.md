# Headstart to Machine Learning – Jupyter Notebook Series

This repository provides a complete beginner-to-advanced journey into **Machine Learning**, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementation using Python. Each section is modular and organized into individual notebooks that you can open directly in Google Colab for hands-on practice.
